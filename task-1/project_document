1. Executive Summary
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the requirements to design and build a Hospital Management System (HMS) with a React JS frontend. The solution covers patient onboarding, appointment workflows, prescriptions, pharmacy and optical store operations, billing, inventory, and revenue analytics, ensuring usability, scalability, security, and compliance.

•	Digitize prescription creation, management, and fulfillment.
•	Streamline pharmacy and optical store sales with integrated billing.
•	Maintain accurate inventory levels for medicines and optical products.
•	Deliver day-wise and month-wise revenue analytics for OPD, Pharmacy, and Optical store.
3. Stakeholders & User Roles
•	Receptionist / Front Desk
•	Doctors (Doctor 1, Doctor 2, Doctor 3)

•	Queue management: statuses (Scheduled, In Queue, With Doctor, Completed).
•	Reschedule/cancel with reason; SMS/WhatsApp/email reminders.
•	Calendar view per doctor; overbooking protection and slot capacity.
Prescription
 
•	Doctor creates e-prescription: diagnosis, notes, medicines, dosage, duration.
•	Templates and favorites; drug interaction warnings from formulary.
•	Attach lab orders; print/export; version history.
•	Patient view (read-only); pharmacist fulfillment status.

•	Price lists, discounts, taxes; integration with billing.
•	Stock alerts for low/expired items.
Optical Store
 
•	Manage optical prescriptions (SPH, CYL, AXIS, ADD, PD).
•	Product catalog (frames, lenses, accessories) with variants.
•	Order management: measurement capture, job ticket, delivery status.
•	Repairs/service tracking.
•	Integration with billing and inventory.
Billing & Invoice
 
•	Generate invoices for OPD, Pharmacy, Optical; multi-item, taxes, discounts.
•	Payment modes: cash, card, wallet, online; partial payments.
•	Auto-link to appointment/prescription; receipt print/email/SMS.
•	Daily settlement; credit notes; audit trail.
•	Reporting on outstanding dues.
Inventory of Medicine & Optical
 
•	GRN/stock-in with supplier, batch, expiry, cost.
•	Stock movements: issue, transfer, adjustments.
•	Reorder levels, lead time, purchase orders.
•	Cycle counts and variance reports.
•	Serialization/barcodes where applicable.
Analytical Reports (OPD, Pharmacy, Optical)
 
•	Day-wise and month-wise revenue by department and total.
•	Top-selling items, doctor-wise consultations, average ticket size.
•	Trends and comparisons (MoM, YoY).
•	Export to CSV/XLSX/PDF.
•	Role-based access to financial reports.

7. Data & Integration
•	Key entities: Patient, Appointment, Doctor, Prescription, Medicine, Optical Product, Invoice, Payment, Inventory Item, Supplier.
•	APIs: REST/GraphQL endpoints for CRUD operations; standard pagination and filtering.
•	External services: SMS/email provider, payment gateway, barcode scanning.
•	Data retention and archival policies.

8. Workflows
•	Registration → Appointment → Consultation (Doctor 1 → Doctor 2 → Doctor 3) → Prescription → Pharmacy/Optical → Billing.
•	Inventory: Purchase → GRN → Stock → Dispense/Sale → Replenish → Audit.

9. Reports & Analytics
•	Revenue dashboard with day-wise and month-wise filters for OPD, Pharmacy, Optical.
•	Doctor-wise and department-wise productivity reports.
